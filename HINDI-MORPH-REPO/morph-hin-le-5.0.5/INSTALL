Basic Installation
==================

	First of all ensure that you have set $setu environment variable to the sampark path.
	if you have not set the setu environment variable then set it by adding the following
	line in your .bash_profile

	export setu=~/hindi_morph[you can choose any directory or location]
	this will only be valid for a session
	or	
	to make changes permanent, run the following 2 commands

	echo "export setu=~/hindi_morph" >> ~/.bashrc
	source ~/.bashrc
	
	you will have to run 'source .bash_profile' to make these changes effective.
	test that the path is set by 'env | grep setu'
